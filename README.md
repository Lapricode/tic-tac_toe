# tic_tac_toe
Tic tac toe multiplayer game

A tic tac toe multiplayer game I made a long time ago. I am using the very slow python library turtle (I had to figure it out from the name), because I didn't know about tkinter back then. There are three game modes: you can play against the computer, you can play with another person (on the same computer) or you can let the computer face itself. Also the grid doesn't have to be 3x3 like in the classic game. You can have as big of a playing area as you want, but be carefull with grids greater than 10x10, because it's gonna be very slow.

Python libraries needed: turtle random time
